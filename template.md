### Integrate design from other verticals
Make sure you’ve reached out to designers from other verticals to assess what other teams may have already created.

### Integrate any existing components
It’s important when you are creating your components that you use any existing Arena tokens, or components within your designs. 

### Express components states
Create states for your component to express it’s design in active, default (static), filled, disabled, error states.

### Accessibility Check
Check your designs for accessibility, we recommend the Contrast Plugin in Figma

### Component fits the the design standard
Check your designs against pre-existing documented rules in  

### Design System Team Review
When your designs are ready, you can ping the #arena-requests? channel on slack and let us know

### Component Review
When your designs have been approved by the Arena team, there will also be an engineering review with the architecture team to make sure the component is ready for development

### Versioning Notes
If you are updating a current design you’ll need to amend the current documentation with versioning notes to let us know what is different
